# Deploying with Docker Compose

In the [kubernetes-web-lightclient] directory, you will find an example of deployment using Yaml files (with Kustomize)

To Launch the application in Docker with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DidierHoarau/kubernetes-web-lightclient
cd kubernetes-web-lightclient/docs/deployments/docker-compose/kubernetes-web-lightclient
docker compose up -d
```
